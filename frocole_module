# Frocole Drupal 9 Module

# Setup

Add Frocole database credentials to Drupal"s /site/default/settings.php.

Example:

$databases["frocole"]["default"] = array (
"database" => "frocole",
"username" => "<mysql user>",
"password" => "<mysql pw>",
"prefix" => "",
"host" => "<mysql hostname>",
"port" => "3306",
"namespace" => "Drupal\\Core\\Database\\Driver\\mysql",
"driver" => "mysql",
);

# Use
The list of Frocole courses is available in Drupal at /admin/frocole/index 

This page offers the options to Add a new Course and View, Delete and Edit existing ones.

The View of a Course shows it"s definition and a list of attached groups and users in those groups. The groupID link of each group in this View page can be used to accessed the export of the group"s feedback items to a CSV file that can be used in Microsoft Excel®.

# Remarks

As the Frocole database does not define SQL relations or constraints, deleting a course will not delete any groups, users or feedback results but orphan them. This renders effectively those groups invalid.
Delete therefor can ONLY usable when there are no groups (and users) attached to it.
When entering the 3 up to 10 performance labels, separate the axis labels with forward slashes (e.g. "/").
